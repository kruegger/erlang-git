# Erlang ArchLinux Package

This is cloned from ArchLinux AUR erlang-git repository(https://aur.archlinux.org/erlang-git.git)

I forked from ArchLinux AUR to support legacy Erlang/OTP 18.X built with OpenSSL 1.0 in x86_64 and ARM platform.

The development branch will be the hmatix-erlang-git and latest changes are available from that branch

# ARM Build

For ARM platform build, please follow the direction in following link:

https://archlinuxarm.org/wiki/Distcc_Cross-Compiling

The procedure is straight-forward. What wiki probably doesn't talked about is

matching the port number between master and client node in following link:
